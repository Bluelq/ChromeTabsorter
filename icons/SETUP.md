# Icon Setup Instructions

## Quick Icon Generation

I've created an icon generator that matches your minimalist black & white branding.

### Option 1: Use the Icon Generator (Recommended)
1. Open `icon-generator.html` in Chrome
2. You'll see 3 canvas previews with your logo design
3. Click each "Download" button to save the PNG files
4. Move the downloaded files to the `icons/` folder
5. Rename them to exactly: `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`

### Option 2: Manual Creation
The design specifications:
- Black background (#000000)
- White lines (#FFFFFF)
- Curved line at top (like a smile/bowl)
- V-shape below
- Minimalist geometric style

### Design Elements:
- **Top curve**: Bezier curve spanning 70% width
- **V-shape**: Two lines meeting at bottom center
- **Line width**: 4% of icon size for curve, 3% for V
- **Positioning**: Top 25% for curve, V extends to 80% height

Once icons are in place, the extension is ready for Part 2!
